# SmugImg: SmugMug photo URLs at any given size.

SmugImg parses GUIDs to photos at SmugMug, as is then able to generate a URL to your image at any given size.

This gem is a bit of reusable logic that I'm extracting from my [personal site](http://www.thetomharrison.com).

This isn't an official SmugMug gem. I'm not affiliated with the company SmugMug.

## Installation and Usage

Sit tight, I'll publish this gem soon.
